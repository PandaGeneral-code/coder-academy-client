# coder-academy-client

## 23 January, 2021

Set up the basic repository, adding the `README` file.

Ended up scrapping the previous project, as I was not sure about the way that I wanted to format this whole thing.

Set up the new projects with the client/server split.

## 24 January, 2021

Created a basic react project with `create react app`.

Removed unnecessary files and added `styled-components`.

Added `craco` for aliasing.

Added `pages` directory.

Added `components` directory.

Added task highlighting and the todo tree extension for task tracking.

Added the default global style that I use for pretty much everything.

A bunch of index files all over the place. Will need to figure out how I would want to format the export/import of pages to display on the main page.

Created the **development** branch so that I can get into the habit of doing commits, leaving proper commit messages, merging, and all that other good stuff.

Adde some styling for this `README` file.

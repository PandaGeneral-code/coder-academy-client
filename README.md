Set up the basic repository, adding the README file.

Ended up scrapping the previous project, as I was not sure about the way that I wanted to format this whole thing.

Set up the new projects with the client/server split.

Created a basic react project with create react app.

Removed unnecessary files and added styled-components.

Added craco for aliasing.

Added pages directory.

Added components directory.

Added task highlighting and the todo tree extension for task tracking.

Added the default global style that I use for pretty much everything.

A bunch of index files all over the place. Will need to figure out how I would want to format the export/import of pages to display on the main page.
